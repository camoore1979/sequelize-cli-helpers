# sequelize-cli-helpers

A power-up for [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) at the command line.

## Intro

[Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is a powerful ORM, and while [sequelize-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli) is helpful, in our workflow we have found several gaps. `sequelize-cli-helpers` is our power-up for improving our Sequelize workflow, especially for generating migrations and models.

_This is not a full replacement for [sequelize-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli)._ For performing and managing migrations, you will still need that tool.

## Usage

Eventually, the following will work:

- `$ sequelize-cli-helpers touch`

## Commands

```

Commands:
  touch  generates a migration file name and touches the empty file

```

## Version

This is currently a pre-production project. It is not yet published, and available only for 
contributors as we work towards an initial `0.1` version.

If you want to see where we _think_ we are headed, please see [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).
